                    Gianni Versace S.r.l. (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdʒanni verˈsaːtʃe]),[a] usually referred to simply as Versace, is an Italian luxury fashion company and trade name founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. The company produces upmarket Italian-made ready-to-wear and accessories, as well as haute couture pieces under the Atelier Versace brand.[6] The Versace logo is the head of Medusa, a Greek mythological figure. The logo came from the floor of ruins in the area of Reggio Calabria that the Versace siblings played in as children. Gianni Versace chose Medusa as the logo because she made people fall in love with her and they had no way back. He hoped his company would have the same effect on people and on those who wore his clothes and shoes.
            
            The Versace brand is known for its innovative designs having symbolic flashy prints and bright colors but with style.[7][8][9] The company announced in 2018 that it would stop using fur in its collections.[10] On 25 September 2018, American Michael Kors Holdings acquired all outstanding shares in Gianni Versace S.r.l. for $2.12 billion (USD);[11] the acquisition was completed on 31 December 2018,[12] keeping on Donatella Versace as head of creative design.

Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio), Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, an icon of the Italian Dolce Vita. Following family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was entirely ousted from the capital of the company by 1993. After this crisis, the brand was revived with a provocative 'Porno Chic' props. In 1999, Gucci was acquired by the French conglomerate Pinault Printemps Redoute, which later became Kering. During the 2010s, Gucci became an iconic 'geek-chic' brand.

In 2019, Gucci operated 487 stores for 17,157 employees, and generated €9.628 billion in sales (€8.2 billion in 2018).[4] Marco Bizzarri is CEO of Gucci since December 2014, and Alessandro Michele creative director since January 2015. Gucci is a subsidiary of the French luxury group Kering.
