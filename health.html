    <p>
        Your skin is the first layer of defense in the body, and you need to protect it. In summer, a lot of sunlight is very harmful to your skin cells because UV rays damage or even kill your skin cells. 
        In winter, fluctuations, redness, allergies and irritation are common skin diseases among many of us. <br>
        Cold temperatures and low humidity levels create dry air that pulls moisture away from the skin. Therefore, protect your skin in both seasons.

        Getting enough sleep at the right times may help prevent physical health problems such as excess weight gain, heart disease, protect your mental health issues and improve your quality of life and safety.
